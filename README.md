## flask-add2numbers
Repo for flask app to add two numbers and deploying them to Heroku
This is a CD pipeline where commiting to the github repo will automatically rebuild the flask app on Heroku.

## Published application on Heroku
https://addnumbers.herokuapp.com/

## What basic concepts does the app showcase?
1. How to use flask to create a simple web app?
2. How to use flask-WTF to create basic web forms to gather input from users?
3. How to work with GET and POST request using same endpoint? (This was the main reason I started this excercise)
4. What all you need to deploy the app to Heroku?
